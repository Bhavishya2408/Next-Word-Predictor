Project Description
===================

This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of predicting the next word in a sequence using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Designed for text sequence prediction, the project integrates model training, evaluation, and deployment via a user-friendly web interface.

Project Overview
================

1\. Data Collection
-------------------

-   **Dataset**: The text of Shakespeare's *Hamlet* is used as the training corpus.

-   **Rationale**: Shakespearean language provides a rich and complex dataset, presenting a challenge to the predictive model.

2\. Data Preprocessing
----------------------

-   **Tokenization**: The text is split into smaller units (tokens) to prepare for sequence creation.

-   **Sequence Generation**: Consecutive tokens are grouped into sequences of fixed length, where the last token in each sequence serves as the target word.

-   **Padding**: Sequences are padded to a uniform length to ensure compatibility with the LSTM model.

-   **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and validation sets to assess the model's performance.

3\. Model Building
------------------

-   **Architecture**:

    -   **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens into dense vector representations.

    -   **LSTM Layers**: Two stacked LSTM layers learn sequential dependencies in the data.

    -   **Dense Layer**: Outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary using a softmax activation function.

-   **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras is used to build and train the model.

4\. Model Training
------------------

-   **Training Procedure**:

    -   The model is trained using sequences derived from the preprocessed text.

    -   A categorical cross-entropy loss function is applied to handle multi-class outputs.

    -   Early stopping is implemented to monitor validation loss and prevent overfitting.

-   **Optimization**: The Adam optimizer is used for efficient gradient descent.

5\. Model Evaluation
--------------------

-   **Metrics**: The model is evaluated on its ability to predict the next word for unseen sequences.

-   **Testing**: Example sentences are fed into the model to assess its predictive accuracy.

6\. Deployment
--------------

-   **Web Application**: A Streamlit-based web interface allows users to:

    -   Input a sequence of words.

    -   Receive the predicted next word in real time.

-   **Key Features**:

    -   Intuitive design with a clean, user-friendly interface.

    -   Responsive layout for seamless interaction.

How It Works
============

1.  **Input**: Users enter a sequence of words into the web app.

2.  **Processing**:

    -   The input text is tokenized and padded.

    -   The model predicts the most likely next word based on the input.

3.  **Output**: The predicted word is displayed in real time.
